<em class="t-gray">How to use multi-factor authentication with gem CLI.</em>

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) greatly increases the security of your account.
RubyGems currently requires that owners of any gem with more than 180 million
cumulative downloads must enable MFA.

You may enable MFA using [WebAuthn](/using-webauthn-mfa-in-command-line) or using [one-time passwords (OTP)](/using-otp-mfa-in-command-line).
