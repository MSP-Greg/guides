Plugins
=======

<em class="t-gray">Extensions that use the RubyGems plugin API.</em>

RubyGems will load plugins in the latest version of each installed gem or
`$LOAD_PATH`.  Plugins must be named 'rubygems\_plugin' (.rb, .so, etc) and
placed at the root of your gem's #require\_path.  Plugins are installed at a
special location and loaded on boot.


Make your own plugin
--------------------

The first step is to follow the conventional file name, we will use
ruby for this example and check that our plugin is loaded correctly:

    % cat lib/rubygems_plugin.rb
    puts 'hello from my plugin!'

    % RUBYOPT=-Ilib gem
    hello from my plugin!
    RubyGems is a sophisticated package manager for Ruby.  This is a
    basic help message containing pointers to more information.

      Usage:
    […]

Of course, our plugin would better be packaged as a gem, which is
described in detail in the [make your own gem][make-your-own-gem]
guide.


### Hooks

RubyGems provides various hooks we can use to add custom features and
even modify how RubyGems behaves. For example, existing hooks allow
executing code before a single gem is installed, after it's built,
after it's installed, after all gem are installed and many others (see
code and documentation for `Gem` as a reference).

Let's consider a simple example plugin that would ask confirmation
interactively before installing gems while supporting a whitelist. We
will leverage the `pre_install` hook, passing a block to
`Gem.pre_install` method. Reading this method documentation, we learn
that our hook will be called with a `Gem::Installer` instance, and
that we can return `false` to abort the installation:

    % cat lib/rubygems_plugin.rb
    WHITELIST_PATH = "#{ENV['HOME']}/.gem/install_audit/whitelist"

    Gem.pre_install do |installer|
      gem_name = installer.spec.name
        whitelist = if File.exist? WHITELIST_PATH
        File.read(WHITELIST_PATH).split
      else
        []
      end

      unless whitelist.include? gem_name
        print "`#{gem_name}' is not whitelisted, install? (y/n): "
        case choice = $stdin.gets.chomp
          when /\Ay/i
          when /\An/i then next false
          else fail "cannot understand `#{choice}'"
        end
      end
    end

    % echo rake > ~/.gem/install_audit/whitelist

    % RUBYOPT=-Ilib gem install hoe
    Fetching: rake-12.3.0.gem (100%)
    Successfully installed rake-12.3.0
    Fetching: hoe-3.16.2.gem (100%)
    `hoe' is not whitelisted, install? (y/n): y
    Successfully installed hoe-3.16.2
    2 gems installed

    % RUBYOPT=-Ilib gem install pry
    Fetching: coderay-1.1.2.gem (100%)
    `coderay' is not whitelisted, install? (y/n): n
    ERROR:  Error installing pry:
      pre-install hook at /…/lib/rubygems_plugin.rb:3 failed for coderay-1.1.2

As expected, RubyGems calls our hook before each gem installation, and
when our hook returns false, it aborts with an explanation.

If you find that the plugin system API lacks the extension point you
need for your needs, please read `CONTRIBUTING.rdoc` in RubyGems
source code, or see the [contributing][contributing] guide.


### Commands

Some plugins also add their own commands to the RubyGems CLI. As an
example, the `graph` plugin listed below registers its own `graph`
command this way:

    require 'rubygems/command_manager'

    Gem::CommandManager.instance.register_command :graph

And implement the command similarly to this:

    require 'rubygems/command'

    class Gem::Commands::GraphCommand < Gem::Command
      def initialize
        super 'graph', 'Graph dependency relationships of installed gems'
      end

      def execute
        # [real command implementation removed for this guide]
      end
    end

We can then use it by executing `gem graph`, and it is also documented
like other RubyGems builtin commands (`gem help commands`,
`gem help graph`…).
